var movie_info_all = new Array("Marty McFly is your average, slacker teenager, who is friendly with a wacky inventor named Doc Brown. When Doc creates a time machine out of a DeLorean car, Marty is accidentally transported into the year 1955. There, he stumbles upon a younger version of his parents, disrupts the meeting, and must get the two together so that they would get married and have him!","Remy is a rat, constantly risking life in an expensive French restaurant because of his love of good food, as well as a desire to become a chef. Yet, obviously, this is a rather tough dream for a rat. But opportunity knocks when a young boy, who desperately needs to keep his job at the restaurant.","The story follows the life of low I.Q. Forrest Gump and his meeting with the love of his life Jenny. The film chronicles his accidental experiences with some of the most important people and events in America from the late 1950's through the 1970's including a meeting with Elvis Presley, JFK, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, fighting in Vietnam, etc. The problem is, he's too stupid to realize the significance of his actions. Forrest becomes representative of the baby boomer generation having walked through life blindly. ","Hallie Parker and Annie James (played by Lindsey Lohan) are identical twins separated at a young age because of their parents' divorce. unknowingly to their parents, the girls are sent to the same summer camp where they meet, discover the truth about themselves, and then plot with each other to switch places. Hallie meets her mother, and Annie meets her father for the first time in years. they then make a plan to set up their parents, which suddenly goes awry with an announcement from their father. the story goes through many different twists and turns, and is an amazing story from start to finish.","Famous film director Salvatore Di Vita (played by real-life film producer Jacques Perrin) returns home late one evening.","The bulk of the film takes place in this flashback, which takes place shortly after World War II. We meet Salvatore. the mischievous, highly intelligent son of a war widow. Six-year-old Salvatore discovers his love for films early and spends every free moment at the local moviehouse--Cinema Paradiso.","Where he develops a friendship with the grandfatherly projectionist, Alfredo, who takes a shine to the young boy and often lets him watch movies in the projection booth. The montage ends as the moviehouse catches fire--film reels in those days were highly flammable. Salvatore saves Alfredo's life, but the old man loses his sight as a result.","Where his girlfriend sleepily tells him that his mother called to tell him that Alfredo has died. It is made clear that Salvatore tends to shy away from committed relationships and that he has not been back to his home village in many years. As she asks him who Alfredo is, Salvatore flashes back to his childhood.","Despite his lack of cooking abilities, discovers and partners the young Remy. Its up to the two of them to avoid the insane head chef, bring the rest of Remy's family up to his standards, win his partner a girl, and, of course, produce the finest Ratatouille in all of France.","The scene abruptly jumps forward a decade or so. Salvatore, now in high school, has taken over Alfredo's duties at the rebuilt moviehouse, though he continues to befriend the old man and look to him for advice--advice that Alfredo often dispenses by quoting classic films. Concurrently, we see that Salvatore has started experimenting with moviemaking with a home movie camera, and we witness as Salvatore meets the new girl, Elena, daughter of a wealthy banker.","We watch Salvatore woo--and win--Elena's heart, only to lose her due to her father's disapproval. As Elena and her family move away, Salvatore leaves town to serve his compulsory military service. His attempts to write her and keep in touch are rebuffed; she never writes back.","Back in the present, we understand that Salvatore has obeyed Alfredo but is now returning home for the first time since he left to attend the funeral. Though his hometown has changed greatly, he now understands why Alfredo thought it was so important that he leave. Alfredo's widow tells him that the old man followed Salvatore's successes with pride and has left him something--an unlabeled reel of film.");

At this point in the 123-minute release, he watches Alfredo's reel and discovers that it is a montage of movie kisses--footage from the old moviehouse that Salvatore and Alfredo had cut from movies way back in the day on orders of the local priest, who considered such scenes indecent. Salvatore is clearly moved by the gift's meaning--one last gift and one last kiss from his father figure.","The original cut then ends with Salvatore viewing the film reel that Alfredo left for him, tears in his eyes. The mood is far more bittersweet, as Salvatore sees Alfredo as both the source of great love in his life--and great pain.");
var movie_info_action = new Array("The Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 American drama film written and directed by Frank Darabont, based on the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. The film stars Tim Robbins as Andrew 'Andy' Dufresne and Morgan Freeman as Ellis Boyd 'Red' Redding.","The film portrays Andy spending nearly two decades in Shawshank State Prison, a fictional penitentiary in Maine and his friendship with Red, a fellow inmate. Despite a lukewarm box office reception that was barely enough to cover its budget, the film received favorable reviews from critics and has since enjoyed a remarkable life on cable television, VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray. This revival is reflected in its high placement on various lists of great movies, and on the Internet Movie Database it contends with The Godfather for first place.","In 1947, a banker named Andrew 'Andy' Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, based on strong circumstantial evidence. He is sentenced to two consecutive life sentences at Shawshank State Penitentiary in Maine, run by Warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton). Andy is quickly befriended by Ellis Boyd 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman), a fellow inmate serving a life sentence who has recently failed to gain parole. Andy finds Red has connections on the outside who can acquire contraband for the inmates.","In the 154-minute version of the film, Salvatore returns to Rome and happens upon a young girl who looks so similar to the teenaged Elena that she can only be a relative. Following the teen, Salvatore is reunited with his longlost love--the girl's mother. He strives to rekindle their romance, and while she clearly wishes it were possible, she finally rejects his entreaties.","The film tells the story of Will Hunting, a prodigy hoodlum from South Boston who works as a janitor at MIT. Good Will Hunting was a financial success, earned several awards, and launched Damon and Affleck into prominence.","We also learn from Elena that the reason they lost touch was because Alfredo asked her to cut ties with him, fearing that Salvatore's romantic fulfillment would only distract him from his destiny and ambitions, limiting what he might achieve in life. Alfredo convinces her that if she loves Salvatore, she must leave him for his own good.");
